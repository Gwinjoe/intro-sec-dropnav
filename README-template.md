### What I learned

I learned about the use of JSON files for frontend projects.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to work on dynamic projects with more complicated stylings to help me grow and build my skills. If it where possible to add projects with backend functionalities, it will be great. Also, i appeal to you all at frontend mentor to please provide more difficult challenges to the free users like us, it will mean a lot. Thanks
